# Ember_Game_Engine
## This is my attempt at learning Game Architecture. I want to have a fun project in which I can develop out a game engine and all of its facets, such as: audio, graphics, resourcing, etc.

This project will have minimal dependencies and will be written in C

Also, currently I am at the very beginning of setting up this engine; using cglm, SDL2, openGL and std libraries in C.
