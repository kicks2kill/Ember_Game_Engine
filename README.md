# Ember_Game_Engine
## This is my attempt at learning Game Architecture. I want to have a fun project in which I can develop out a game engine and all of its facets, such as: audio, graphics, resourcing, etc.

This project will have minimal dependencies and will be written in pure C. As it stands now, I have written a 2D/3D math library from scratch to utilize in other parts of my engine. (Still need to add quaternions and matrice math)

Need to do:
Graphics (OpenGL)
UI (will use Nuklear)
Audio (undecided)
Resourcing
