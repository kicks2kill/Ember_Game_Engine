# Ember_Game_Engine
## This is my attempt at learning Game Architecture. I want to have a fun project in which I can develop out a game engine and all of its facets, such as: audio, graphics, resourcing, etc.

This project is going to be mostly written from scratch in C, but with the help of certain libraries to save some time (such as openGL 3.3)
