# Ember_Game_Engine
## This is my attempt at learning Game Architecture. I want to have a fun project in which I can develop out a game engine and all of its facets, such as: audio, graphics, resourcing, etc.

This project will have minimal dependencies and will be written in a C-like C++

Also, currently I am at the very beginning of setting up this engine. As it stands right now, it is mostly code learning openGL that I will replace as I become more experienced with creating a renderer
